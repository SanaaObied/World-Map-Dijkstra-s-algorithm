                                                                            Overview:

This project implements Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to determine the shortest and most cost-effective route between two cities on a map. Users can interactively select cities, and the program will calculate and display the route with the lowest cost, using real-world data for at least 50 cities. The system is optimized to handle multiple queries efficiently without excessive memory usage, ensuring fast results for large datasets. Routes are visualized on the map, providing an intuitive and interactive experience.
